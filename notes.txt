Our idea thus far!
Api for food recipes biased on what the user currently has available in their kitchen and im multiple languages.
Food Api -https://spoonacular.com/food-api
2nd Api translates in multiple languages using Google Translate Api.
Translate Api -https://english.api.rakuten.net/googlecloud/api/google-translate1?endpoint=apiendpoint_1fa880dc-2f35-4373-85b4-06298a69d1c6

**Post saturday Meetup 10/2/21!**


-Since we cant use bootstrap lets Use https://materializecss.com/ 
for css lay outs and designs. 

- a Auto complete (input form) https://materializecss.com/ (example: User types in Egg. Auto complete puts out "Eggs")

-Steph Suggested we use screen castify to make a gif . 
 on how to api works.

-use a carousel to display meal options with current ingredients.

- Loading screen (loading wheel (food))
dribbble.com 'Foodie Maryam Loading-1'

- Nav bar 

- a copy right at the footer. 

- only fetch the top 25 results (user wont scroll thru 50 options)

- Use Switch for light mode and Dark mode. 

-IF we have time use a carousel to home screen of user favorite meals used thus far

- (Future use) Check boxes or Switches (ie. user food allergy's)
