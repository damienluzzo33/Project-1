Our idea thus far!
Api for food recipes biased on what the user currently has available in their kitchen and im multiple languages.
Food Api -https://spoonacular.com/food-api
2nd Api translates in multiple languages using Google Translate Api.
Translate Api -https://english.api.rakuten.net/googlecloud/api/google-translate1?endpoint=apiendpoint_1fa880dc-2f35-4373-85b4-06298a69d1c6

*Assignments as of now*
Chris and Chamo are working on HTML CSS and Bootstrap
Stephanie is working on Readme. and Spoonacular.
Damien is working on JavaScript and looking into class activity's for resources
Vincent is working on Google Api and if we have time Thursday(** MongoDB** try and connect to a database) .

-----------------------------------------------------------

**Post saturday Meetup 10/2/21!**


-Since we cant use bootstrap lets Use https://materializecss.com/ 
for css lay outs and designs. 

- a Auto complete (input form) https://materializecss.com/ (example: User types in Egg. Auto complete puts out "Eggs")

-Steph Suggested we use screen castify to make a gif . 
 on how to api works.

-use a carousel to display meal options with current ingredients.

- Loading screen (loading wheel (food))
dribbble.com 'Foodie Maryam Loading-1'

- Nav bar : Mobile nav bar: hamburger nav bar

- a copy right at the footer. 

- only fetch the top 25 results (user wont scroll thru 50 options)

- Use Switch for light mode and Dark mode. 

-IF we have time use a carousel to home screen of user favorite meals used thus far

- (Future use) Check boxes or Switches (ie. user food allergy's)

-----------------------------------------------------------

*Spoonacular api maybe's*
Search recipes by ingredients
get recipe information
maybe get recipe information bulk
maybe autocomplete recipe search
get recipes ingredient list
get analyzed recipe instructions
classify cuisine
maybe analyze recipe search query
ingredient search
convert amounts
maybe parse ingredients
maybe glycemic load
auto complete ingrdient search
get ingredient substitutes
meal type
diet
